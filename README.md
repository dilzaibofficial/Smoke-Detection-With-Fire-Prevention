# Fire Detection IoT Simulation

This project demonstrates an IoT-based fire detection system using Cisco Packet Tracer. The simulation includes a car emitting smoke, which triggers connected IoT devices like a smoke detector, fire sprinkler, and alarms.

## **Project Overview**
- **Simulator:** Cisco Packet Tracer
- **Scenario:**
  - An old car emits smoke.
  - Smoke detector identifies the smoke.
  - Connected devices (fire sprinkler, siren) respond accordingly.
- **IoT Devices Used:**
  - Old IoT Car
  - Smoke Detector
  - Fire Sprinkler
  - Siren
  - Home Gateway
